# TODO

In on particular order (_no point in using the issue tracker just yet_):

- [X] Execute "configuration" against hosts in parallel/concurrently.
- [ ] Add support for file/directory checksums and copying only if changed.
- [ ] Add support for local environment variable interpolation?
- [X] A pony?
