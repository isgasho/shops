    description: |
      shops is a simple command-line tool written in Go that helps you
      simplify the way you manage configuration across a set of machines.
      shops is your configuration management tool of choice when Chef, Puppet,
      Ansible are all too complicated and all you really want to do is run a
      bunch of regular shell against a set of hosts.
